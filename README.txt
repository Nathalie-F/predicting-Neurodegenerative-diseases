## INTRODUCTION
	Neurodegenerative diseases, most prevalent in aging populations, is a general term that stands for a bunch of diseases that are related to progressive damage of the nervous system cells, including neurons. Therefore, they affect many of the patient's body activites like balance, movement, breathing, heart function and so one. Most of them are genetic. But few ones can be caused either by human misbehavior like alcoholism or medical condition such as tumor,strokes and viruses. Sometimes the causes can be even unknown. These diseases are so serious and can even be life-threatning. Unfortunately they are incurable.

	Nowadays, Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. The most common are Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. In fact, according to a reasearch paper from Harvard University, "THE CHALLENGE OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES" , 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease and 1 million from Parkinson. This situation increases the curiosity of many resarchers given that they want to understand the real causes of these diseases in order the treat and prevent them. While who are part of medical field try to find treatments that may help improve symptoms, relieve pain, and increase mobility, those who are evolving in the data science field try to find the perfect model to predict accurately the presence of a neurodegenerative disease in an individual. Earlier this detection is done, better it is for the identification of patients who must take part to clinical trial realized by neuroprotective agents to try and halt disease progression.

	As a future data scientist, we must also try to find a way to predict neurodegenerative diseases, as our colleagues have done. That is why, through the Data Insight-supported data scientist program, we need to work on this project PREDICTING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE. In the rest of this paper, I will work especially on Parkinson's disease patient dataset created by Max Little of the University of Oxford.
